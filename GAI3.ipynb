      "## Image Generation Prompt: Lion Dance in the Rain\n",
      "\n",
      "**Style:** Photorealistic, slightly desaturated, with a cinematic feel.  Think Wong Kar-wai meets National Geographic.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Subject:** A vibrant lion dance performance taking place in a bustling, rain-soaked Asian street market.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Specifics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Lion:** Two performers inside a meticulously detailed lion costume, preferably a Cantonese-style lion with bright, rich colors (golds, reds, greens) that are slightly muted by the rain. The lion should be energetically performing a dynamic pose, perhaps mid-leap or turn, showing the skill of the performers.  Visible details of the costume are important, such as intricate embroidery and the lion's mane.\n",
      "* **Setting:** A crowded, narrow street market in a historic Asian city (e.g., Hong Kong, Guangzhou).  Visible elements should include:\n",
      "    * **Rain:** Heavy, but not obscuring, rain falling in sheets.  Show the glistening wetness on the streets, awnings, and the lion's costume.  Reflective surfaces like puddles should highlight the city lights.\n",
      "    * **Market:**  Stalls displaying vibrant produce, traditional crafts, or street food.  A sense of lively activity, despite the rain, is key. People should be visible, but not overly sharp in focus â€“ slightly blurred to emphasize the lion dancers.\n",
      "    * **Lighting:**  A mix of warm light from street lamps and shop signs, contrasted by the cool, grey light of the overcast sky and rain.  The lion should be well-lit, drawing the eye.\n",
      "* **Atmosphere:**  Energetic, vibrant, but also contemplative and atmospheric. The rain adds a layer of mystery and beauty. The overall mood should be celebratory yet slightly melancholic, reflecting the beauty of the performance even in the downpour.\n",
      "* **Camera Angle:**  A dynamic angle, perhaps slightly low to emphasize the lion's power and the energy of the performance.  Consider a shallow depth of field to blur the background and draw focus to the lion.\n",
      "* **Resolution:**  High resolution (at least 4K).\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Optional additions:**  Include a few small details, such as a red lantern glowing faintly in the rain, or a few umbrellas visible in the background.  The background should be busy but not distracting from the main subject.\n",
